# Deep-Learning

1. Neural Network: The SVHN dataset contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street level photos. It is one of the most popular image recognition datasets. It has been used in neural networks created by Google to improve map quality by automatically transcribing the address numbers from a patch of pixels. The transcribed number with a known street address helps pinpoint the location of the building it represents.

Objective:
Build a feed forward neural network model that can identify the digits in the images.

Dataset:
Here, we will use a subset of the original data to save some computation time. The dataset is provided as a .h5 file

2. Convolutional Neural Network: We use the same SVHN dataset. We build a CNN model that can identify the digits in the images.
